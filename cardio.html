        <h2>About Cardio</h2>
        <p>Cardio, short for cardiovascular exercise, is any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets your blood pumping. Common cardio exercises include running, biking, swimming, and jumping rope. Cardio is important for maintaining a healthy heart and lungs, as well as for burning calories and losing weight.</p>
